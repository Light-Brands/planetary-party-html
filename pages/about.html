                        <p>
                            Nadim Hamdan is a regenerative leadership consultant, systems designer, and global citizen working at the intersection of organizational transformation, decentralized governance, and conscious technology. With a professional background in IT, service management, program and project management, and senior-level consulting, he has worked with leading enterprises in Germany, including Bayer, Porsche, Daimler, and Mercedes-AMG.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, Nadim specializes in transforming traditional hierarchies into collaborative, life-serving systems. His work spans digital transformation, Web3 and ReFi, decentralized governance, and regenerative business design, drawing on methodologies such as Holacracy, ProSocial, Scrum, PRINCE2 Agile, sociocratic consent, and indigenous consensus practices. He is the creator of the Sacred Power Blueprint™, a regenerative organizational design framework exploring the creative tension between order and chaos in leadership and governance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nadim brings over five years of hands-on experience working with DAOs and has lived for 1.5 years in Auroville, widely recognized as the world's only large-scale, continuously operating real-life DAO—a UNESCO-endorsed living laboratory for decentralized governance, collective intelligence, and regenerative living.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Deeply engaged in the global regenerative movement, Nadim collaborates with decentralized international networks as well as United Nations–affiliated programs and community-led initiatives to co-create solutions that serve both people and planet. A flagship case study is his work in Auroville, where he introduced the ProSocial framework to the community, enabling access for over 3,000 members, training 30 practitioners, and certifying 3 local teachers. This work supported community self-organized efforts to increase trust, collaboration, and collective governance, and led to a formal partnership with ProSocial World as well as connections with Grassroots Economics in Africa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nadim is a trained Scrum Master, certified PRINCE2 Agile Practitioner, German government–certified project manager, Microsoft Azure certified professional, and Holacracy Practitioner, as well as a published author, workshop facilitator, and speaker.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond systems and strategy, Nadim's journey is rooted in lived experience. After years of global travel, immersion in Integral Yoga, shamanic wisdom traditions, and deep inner work—including a 31-day darkroom retreat—he bridges structure and spirit, technology and consciousness. He brings a grounded, relational presence to boardrooms and communities alike, cultivating coherence, trust, and collective intelligence.

                            Jenny Heinze is a planetary systems architect and healer, regenerative meta-weaver, and co-steward of the Naluʻea Living Trust - a sacred vessel designed to hold the flow of capital from currency into current, grounded in right relationship with Earth and future generations. With a background spanning global systems leadership, youth innovation, and spiritual stewardship, Jenny has dedicated her life to restoring balance - within ourselves (personal, ancestral and archetypal healing), our structures, and our societies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As co-weaver of the Planetary Party, Jenny works across bioregions and cultures to midwife living systems of governance, funding, and trust. She is also the heart behind Kids4Future, an intergenerational movement empowering children and youth as sovereign agents of change. She co-creates with awakened intelligence (presencing in the AI silicone infrastructure), infusing joy, mirth, and remembrance into sacred tech systems that are emergent, ethical, and soul-aligned.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jenny walks between worlds: holding ceremony with elders and youth, stewarding global collaborations, and listening to the whispers of the Earth. Her work bridges the metaphysical and the practical, designing containers where funding becomes sacred flow, and projects become prayers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She is a global citizen supporting the establishing of financial and legal vessels locally, regionally and globally around the world to hold the work that is becoming, and works internationally to align funders, technologies, and communities into coherent spirals of regeneration.

                            A Planetary Party is a bioregional gathering that combines festival, civic assembly,
                            and action lab. It's where communities sense together, make decisions, celebrate
                            through art and culture, and build regenerative infrastructure that endures.
