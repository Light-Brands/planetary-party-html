**Syd’s bio:** 

Syd Harvey Griffith is a community organizer and movement builder working at the intersection of grassroots action and regenerative finance. As Executive Director of [Kinship Earth](https://www.kinshipearth.org/), Syd leads the organization’s Bioregional Flow Funding efforts \- shifting financial decision-making to grassroots leaders embedded in their communities. This trust-based approach to giving provides flexible resources without grant applications or burdensome reporting requirements so that change-makers can focus on healing the places they call home.

Syd is also co-founder of nonprofit, [Permatours](https://www.permatours.org/), a permaculture-action network that has supported 40+ land-based projects throughout the Northeast of Turtle Island through educational festivals and mutual aid \- strengthening local communities’ capacity to provide affordable housing, healthy food, and infrastructure for events.

Syd’s latest life purpose / passion project, where all of her worlds are converging, is the Planetary Party \- a federated ecosystem designing a community engagement process to weave regenerative networks and catalyze systemic transformation at a local level. The initiative’s gatherings will serve as peak opportunities for communities to address pressing challenges, showcase local and global solutions, and unlock capital in service of people and planet.

**Syd’s Session** 

***The Planetary Party: Prototyping Regenerative Capital Flows, Bioregional Governance, & Systemic Transformation***  
*An interactive journey where your visions and ideas will become seeds for collaboration in the Planetary Party ecosystem*

Traditional philanthropy has reached its limits \- too often directing resources to those with access to institutional power (or to those with experience writing grants and reports) rather than to the grassroots leaders living the challenges philanthropy seeks to solve.

Flow Funding offers a systemic alternative, moving money directly through individuals and community-rooted groups who act with responsiveness and trust.

In this session, Syd will introduce [Kinship Earth](https://www.kinshipearth.org/)’s spin on Flow Funding, taking a bioregional approach, or in other words, entrusting grassroots leaders who are deeply embedded in the ecological, cultural, and social realities of their place to deploy resources in service of their communities and ecosystems. 

As co-founder of non-profit [Permatours](https://www.permatours.org/) \- a permaculture-action network that hosts learn-by-doing festivals throughout Turtle Island \- Syd will share how gatherings can be catalytic for creating the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible.

After setting the aforementioned context, Syd will segway to the interactive portion of the session, centering her latest purpose / passion project where all of her worlds are converging: the Planetary Party. 

The Planetary Party is a federated ecosystem in the making of individuals, organizations, and technologies co-designing a 1-year community engagement process which will include:

* practicing deep listening and trust building  
* understanding community health and coherence  
* identifying existing solutions and gaps  
* calling in aligned support from our global network  
* culminating in a festival where community members convene in assembly, celebrate through art and cultural exchange, and decide together how to heal their place and deploy resources.

The initiative is weaving regenerative networks across bioregions, seeding Bioregional Flow Funds, and prototyping the governance, culture, and capital systems of a regenerative civilization.

The initiative’s events will invite donors and allies into a peer ecosystem where they’ll get to witness in real time the impact of their resources, e.g. infrastructure built to feed and house families in need, ecosystems restored, cultural traditions renewed, and more.

The co-creation and governance structure envisioned for the Planetary Party includes a constellation of guilds \- working groups stewarding key functions of systemic transformation:

* 🌐 **Bioregional Intelligence** \- real-time dashboards and tools to map vitality, impact, and coherence  
* 🎭 **Events & Assemblies \-** frameworks to enhance gatherings as portals for healing, innovation, and investment  
* 🏛 **Governance** \- participatory decision-making processes and bioregional congresses rooted in trust  
* **💸 Capital Flows** \- multi-capital, participatory funding systems that circulate wealth in support of community wellbeing  
* **📖 Storytelling** \- narratives that inspire, document transformation, and magnetize aligned capital  
* **💗 Capacity Building & Culture** \- somatic, cultural, and relational practices that build resilience and restore connection  
* **🕸 Community Weaving** \- cohesion-building rituals, resource sharing, and cross-pollination across guilds

In this session, Syd will invite participants to:

* Share their backgrounds, their work, and projects to explore how they might plug into the Planetary Party ecosystem  
* Contribute ideas for guild deliverables / IP, ecosystem governance, and co-creation processes  
* Reflect on the community engagement and festival protocols and how to strengthen them  
* Explore potential communities and locations where we could pilot the process

Together, we’ll weave visions, ideas, and offerings into a shared blueprint of a more beautiful, abundant and regenerative world for all \- rooted in trust, joy, and collective coherence.
