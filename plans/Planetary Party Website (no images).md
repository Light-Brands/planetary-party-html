### THE PLANETARY PARTY

**A New Myth of Humanity Is Emerging**  
Across the world, communities are rebuilding culture, restoring ecosystems,  
innovating new futures, and remembering how to act together.  
**The Planetary Party** is designed to function as the connective architecture that  
helps these movements coordinate, amplify one another, and become something  
larger than themselves, a living evolution of what it means to be human.

---

**The Planetary Party** is an emerging, living ecosystem that catalyzes communities to  
**sense, decide** , and **act** together in service to life.  
This is not another movement.  
We are **revealing** the one that is already here.  
***What's missing isn't effort.***  
***It's coordination, shared maps, and flow-funding resources.***

---

An invitation:  
To Meta weavers, change makers, regenerative projects and communities, cultural  
movements, wisdom keepers, youth initiatives, innovators, storytellers, organizers,  
and visionaries...  
Co-create with the rising, global self-coordinating mycelial network  
Synergize and join genius to funnel nutrients where it’s needed \- at the community,  
bioregional, and global level

**The Planetary Party Protocol**  
A Social Architecture that helps communities:  
This process is simple, natural, and rooted in how living systems evolve.  
The Protocol exists to weave what's working, amplify what's emerging, and help  
communities act together in service of life

## THEORY OF CHANGE

#### OUR THEORY OF CHANGE

**Add: Context / why we are doing what we are / problem statement (metacrisis,**  
**incoherence within and across bioregions – lacking connective tissue)**  
**THE PLANETARY PARTY PROTOCOL**

The Planetary Party Protocol Living Architecture

1. **SENSE** — The Roots  
   Communities gather — in circles, festivals, assemblies, rituals — to listen for what's  
   alive, needed, and possible.  
2. **SEE** — The Mycelial Map  
   Insights flow into Bioregional Intelligence Dashboards, revealing shared priorities,  
   patterns, and opportunities.  
3. **FLOW** — The Water Table  
   Local Flow Funds move capital quickly and relationally toward what communities  
   name as important.  
4. **CELEBRATE** — The Bloom  
   Gatherings become civic ceremonies. Joy becomes governance. Culture becomes  
   coordination.  
5. **REGENERATE** — The Spiral  
   Communities learn from each cycle, deepen coherence, and return stronger — like a  
   forest growing new rings.  
   **Weaving a Learning Bioregional Network**

# The Structures That Hold The

# Work

Three Core Components Bringing The Protocol to Life  
🧭 **Bioregional Intelligence Dashboards**  
The living map of the bioregion — ecological, cultural, economic, and social indicators made  
visible.  
Dashboards support:  
shared decision-making  
transparency  
alignment  
reinvestment  
collective learning  
accountability rooted in relationship  
*They are the mycelial map beneath the whole ecosystem.*  
💧 **Local Flow Funds**  
Trust-based, relational capital that moves quickly to where life is asking for it.  
Flow Funds:  
•resource community-led priorities  
•reduce competition  
•activate collaboration  
•reveal abundance  
•create regenerative economic pathways  
*They are the water table beneath the work.*  
**Bioregional Embassies**

Living bridges linking community wisdom with governments, philanthropy, and institutions.  
Embassies:  
translate local priorities into coordinated support  
ensure resources flow to real needs  
anchor cultural \+ ecological stewardship  
uplift community intelligence to the policy level  
hold relational coherence across sectors  
*They help ensure that community voices guide decisions at every level.*

# A Bioregion’s Journey

# Through the Planetary Party

# Protocol.

A sequence might unfold like this:  
*Each bioregion moves at its own rhythm \- and the regeneration accumulates like a forest*  
*growing deeper roots.*

# Why It Works

It follows the principles of Living Systems.  
The Planetary Party Protocol mirrors nature’s logic:  
Add cool Spiral image?  
systems sense  
signals circulate  
relationships adapt  
intelligence distributes  
resources flow where needed  
coherence emerges  
life regenerates

It is living governance, rooted in culture and ecology.  
The future belongs to systems that can feel and respond together.

# Step Into The Weave

Your Bioregion Can Begin This Work Now  
If your community wants to:  
host a Planetary Party  
create a council  
start a Flow Fund  
develop a dashboard  
join a guild  
surface priorities  
map networks  
build trust  
align efforts

## GUILDS

##### PLANETARY PARTY

##### PROTOCOL GUILDS:

##### Our Nervous System

The Planetary Party is powered by **Guilds** : autonomous, interconnected teams stewarding  
different dimensions of the ecosystem.

Each Guild is an organ , carrying a unique function within a larger living body.  
Together, they inform the nervous system of the Planetary Party \- sensing, signaling,  
regenerating, and weaving coherence across bioregions.  
Guilds connect , co-create, and steward the protocols, tools, rituals, data, and cultural  
integrity that help communities sense, decide, and act together.

### 🌿 What the Guilds Are

### 🌍 WHY GUILDS MAKE THE PPP WORK

### 🌺 THE NINE GUILDS

***Each one a vital organ.***  
*Each one a keeper of a different kind of intelligence.*

### 1\. Bioregional Intelligence Guild

***The Brain \- processing information in the body through stories, data, land, and culture to***  
***integrate, regulate and direct action***  
This Guild develops the **Bioregional Intelligence Dashboards** and the sensing capacities  
behind them.  
They:  
● weave ecological, cultural, economic, and social indicators  
● build maps that reveal what’s working and what’s needed  
● support bioregions in gathering local data, stories, patterns  
● guide the sensing → mapping → coherence arc  
● translate complexity into clarity

They help communities see themselves \- coherently.

### 2\. Technology & Data Sovereignty Guild

***The Nervous System — the tools that send signals to the organs of the body to respond***  
***and connect the whole.***  
This Guild creates the digital and technical infrastructure behind the PPP.  
They steward:  
● Data sovereignty practices  
● Ledgers for Flow Funds  
● Dashboard interfaces & bioregional mapping tools  
● Interoperability between bioregions  
● Open-source tools and systems aligned with community governance  
They ensure the tech serves life — not the other way around.

### 3\. Ecosystem Weaving Guild

***The Connective Tissue — harmonizing guilds, networks, and bioregions.***  
This Guild helps movements recognize themselves as part of one interconnected ecosystem.  
They:  
● weave across sectors and communities  
● convene aligned organizations

They steward:  
● participatory processes  
● community assemblies  
● bioregional councils

● consent & coherence-based decision-making  
● agreements \+ charters  
● role clarity \+ organizational rhythms  
They help communities make decisions that emerge from coherence.

### 7\. Event Production & Cultural Activation Guild

***gatherings.***  
This Guild produces convergence festivals, ceremonies, and civic celebrations.  
They handle:  
● safety  
● logistics & infrastructure  
● flow of programming  
● ambiance, aesthetics, and culture

***agricultural, and place-based regeneration.***  
This Guild anchors:  
● food systems  
● water systems

● Other avenues to unlock capital to flow in service of local communities and  
ecosystems per their needs  
They help capital flow with the logic of ecosystems vs. extraction.

### 🌞 THE ANCHOR CIRCLE

***The Muscles – Moving the body, Upholding the integrity and coherence of the whole.***  
The Anchor Circle represents:  
● each Guild’s voice  
● shared protocols  
● alignment across the ecosystem  
● coherence between culture, governance, and action  
● evolutions of the PPP’s global framework  
They help the whole organism stay attuned to itself.
